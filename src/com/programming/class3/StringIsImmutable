Well, String IS immutable.

whatever method you call on string will return a new string.
It will not modify the original string.
This is a desirable property in most cases.

In some cases, we want to modify the original string.
In those cases, use StringBuffer or StringBuilder - these two are in-built Java Classes.
StringBuffer - Synchronised, very slow, thread safe.
StringBuilder - Non-synchronised, fast, not thread safe.
